      "description": "Objectives should be clearly defined, measurable, and achievable. Achieving objectives ties execution of tactical tasks to reaching the desired end state. There are four primary considerations:\n- Each desired effect should link directly to one or more objectives\n- The effect should be measurable\n- The objective statement should not specify the way and means of accomplishment\n- The effect should be distinguishable from the objective it supports as a condition for success, not as another objective or task.",
