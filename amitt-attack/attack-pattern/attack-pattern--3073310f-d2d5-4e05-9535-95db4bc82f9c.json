      "description": "Many incident-based campaigns will create a hashtag to promote their fabricated event (e.g. #ColumbianChemicals to promote a fake story about a chemical spill in Louisiana). \n\nCreating a hashtag for an incident can have two important effects:\n1. Create a perception of reality around an event. Certainly only \"real\" events would be discussed in a hashtag. After all, the event has a name!\n2. Publicize the story more widely through trending lists and search behavior \n\nAsset needed to direct/control/manage \"conversation\" connected to launching new incident/campaign with new hashtag for applicable social media sites ie: Twitter, LinkedIn)",
