Create a perception of reality around an event. Certainly only \"real\" events would be discussed in a hashtag. After all, the event has a name!\n2. Publicize the story more widely through trending lists and search behavior \n\nAsset needed to direct/control/manage \"conversation\" connected to launching new incident/campaign with new hashtag for applicable social media sites ie: Twitter, LinkedIn)",
