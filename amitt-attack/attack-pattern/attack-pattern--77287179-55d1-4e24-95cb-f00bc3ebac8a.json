      "description": "The promotion of beneficial master narratives is perhaps the most effective method for achieving long-term strategic narrative dominance. From a \"whole of society\" perpective the promotion of the society's core master narratives should occupy a central strategic role. From a misinformation campaign / cognitive security perpectve the tactics around master narratives center more precisely on the day-to-day promotion and reinforcement of this messaging. In other words, beneficial, high-coverage master narratives are a central strategic goal and their promotion consitutes an ongoing tactical struggle carried out at a whole-of-society level. \n\nBy way of example, major powers are promoting master narratives such as:\n* \"Huawei is detetmined to build trustworthy networks\"\n* \"Russia is the victim of bullying by NATO powers\"\n* \"USA is guided by its founding principles of liberty and egalitarianism\"\n\nTactically, their promotion covers a broad spectrum of activities both on- and offline.",
