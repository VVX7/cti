Most notably they amplified social media speculation that many of the teens involved were \u201ccrisis actors\u201d nefariously injected into the conversation by outside actors with an anti-gun poltical agenda. Other amplifications included ongoing harassment of survivors and claims that the event is a hoax from the right; and fatalist cynicism about gun reform from the left.",
