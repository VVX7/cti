This assessment flips to a 1 in cases of environments where security trains employees to be vigilant or in specialized industries where competitive intelligence and business intelligence train employees to be highly aware.  Most likely more complex for an adversary to detect as methods move to physical or non traditionally monitored mechanisms (such as phone calls outside of call centers).  Furthermore, the content of such an interaction may be lost due to lack of collection.",

Assuming a HUMINT operation and specialized circumstances, the adversary difficulty becomes 1.   Social engineering can be easily done remotely via email or phone.  In contrast, HUMINT operations typically would require physical contact at some point in the process, increasing the difficulty.",
